# Autonomous Robotics and Drone Control System

This project is a simplified implementation of an autonomous robotics and drone control system using Java. It provides basic functionalities for controlling a generic drone, including takeoff, landing, movement, and battery management.

## Features

- **Drone Control**: Perform basic drone control operations such as takeoff, landing, movement, and turning.
- **Battery Management**: Monitor and manage the battery level of the drone to ensure uninterrupted operation.
- **Quadcopter Implementation**: Concrete implementation of a quadcopter drone with simulated flight behavior.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/your-username/autonomous-robotics-drone-control.git>

```

1. **Compile and run the Java program:**
    
    ```bash
    cd autonomous-robotics-drone-control
    javac AutonomousRoboticsSystem.java
    java AutonomousRoboticsSystem
    
    ```
    
2. **Interact with the program:**
    - Create an instance of the `Quadcopter` class to control a quadcopter drone.
    - Use methods like `takeOff`, `land`, `move`, `turn`, `checkBatteryLevel`, and `chargeBattery` to control the drone.

## Example

```java
public class AutonomousRoboticsSystem {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a quadcopter drone
        Drone quadcopter = new Quadcopter();

        // Perform operations
        quadcopter.takeOff();
        quadcopter.move(10);
        quadcopter.turn(90);
        quadcopter.move(5);
        quadcopter.checkBatteryLevel();
        quadcopter.land();
        quadcopter.chargeBattery();
    }
}

```

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with real drone hardware for practical testing and application.
- Implementation of more advanced flight algorithms and maneuvers.
- Addition of real-time sensor integration for environment awareness.
